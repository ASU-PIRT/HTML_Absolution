# HTML Absolution Tool

## Description
A free and open source PyScript-based tool developed by ASU's Physics Instructional Resource Team (PIRT) to simplify the code of documents imported into HTML from word-processing applications, such as Google Docs, .docx, or .odt documents.

The intention behind this project is to simplify the arbitrary tagging produced by the word processor and make the HTML code immediately compatible with pre-established CSS styles created for documents to be used in ASU courses.
